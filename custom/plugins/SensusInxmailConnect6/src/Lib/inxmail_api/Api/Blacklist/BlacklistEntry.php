/**
 * An <i>Inx_Api_Blacklist_BlacklistEntry</i> can block individual addresses or complete address ranges so 
 * they can not be added to the Inxmail recipient list, neither by import nor by subscription or in any other ways. 
 * A few examples:
 * <ul>
 * <LI>name@firm.com - The address 'name@firm.com' is blocked.
 * <LI>*@firm.com - All personnel of this firm is blocked.
 * <LI>*.tv - No addresses from Tuvalu.
 * <LI>spam* - All addresses beginning with 'spam' are blocked.
 * <LI>martin@* - All Martins are blocked.
 * </ul>
 * Note: The usage of the blacklist requires the api user right: <i>Inx_Api_UserRights::BLACKLIST_FEATURE_USE</i>
 * <p>
 * For an example on how to use the blacklist, see the <i>Inx_Api_Blacklist_BlacklistManager</i> documentation.
