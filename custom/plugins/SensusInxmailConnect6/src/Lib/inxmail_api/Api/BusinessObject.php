 * The API gives access to objects of Inxmail, which are called "BusinessObjects".
 * For example, a mailing lists in Inxmail is such a Business Object.
 *
 * Values <i>of Inx_Api_BusinessObject</i>s can be changed with the "update" methods
 * (like <i>updateName()</i>). By calling <i>commitUpdate()</i> on such an object, 
 * changes will be passed to the server. Rollback is done by the <i>reload()</i> 
 * method, which reloads the object and discards all uncomitted changes.
