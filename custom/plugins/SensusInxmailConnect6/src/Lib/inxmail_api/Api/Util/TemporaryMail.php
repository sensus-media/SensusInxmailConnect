/**
 * A <i>Inx_Api_Util_TemporaryMail</i> is a mailing that may be sent to a single recipient that does not have to be a
 * registered recipient in Inxmail. 
 * A temporary mailing behaves mostly like a simple version of a normal <i>Inx_Api_Mailing_Mailing</i>. 
 * However, the mailing will not be personalized and will not be saved in Inxmail and therefore won't be trackable. 
 * <i>TemporaryMail</i>s may be sent using the <i>Inx_Api_Util_TemporaryMailSender</i>.
 * <p>
 * Because a <i>TemporaryMail</i> does not belong to a specific list, you have to specify some information not
 * needed when using a normal <i>Mailing</i>. The most important is the recipient address. 
 * Normally, the recipient address is determined by the list, but as a temporary mail does not belong to any list, 
 * there is no predefined recipient address. 
 * The same is true for the reply address, though this address is not technically required to send the mail. 
 * The sender address, on the other hand, does not have to be specified as long as it is configured in the list 
 * that was passed on the creation of the temporary mailing.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> While it is discouraged to explicitly set the recipient address of a standard
 * <i>Inx_Api_Mailing_Mailing</i>, this is a technical requirement for the <i>TemporaryMail</i>. 
 * You won't be able to send a temporary mail to a recipient not registered in Inxmail without specifying the sender 
 * address, though the send method will return <i>true</i>. 
 * You may, however, send the mailing to a recipient known by Inxmail, without explicitly specifying the sender address. 
 * To do so, use the <i>Inx_Api_Util_TemporaryMailSender::sendTemporaryMail($oTemporaryMail, $iRecipientId)</i> method. 
 * This method will also personalize the mailing for the given recipient.
 * <p>
 * For an example on how to send a temporary mail, see the <i>Inx_Api_Util_TemporaryMailSender</i> documentation.
