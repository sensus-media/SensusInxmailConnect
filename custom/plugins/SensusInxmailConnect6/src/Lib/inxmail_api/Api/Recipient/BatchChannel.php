/**
 * An <i>Inx_Api_Recipient_BatchChannel</i> can (and should) be used for manipulation of large amounts of data. 
 * The <i>createRecipient()</i> and <i>selectRecipient()</i> methods are used to create and/or select a recipient. 
 * After creating or selecting a recipient, the following batch commands operate on this until another recipient is selected.
 *  Operations are executed in exactly the same order as they are added to the <i>Inx_Api_Recipient_BatchChannel</i>.
 * <p>
 * An <i>Inx_Api_Recipient_BatchChannel</i> may be used to perform the following operations:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Select recipients: <i>selectRecipient($sKeyValue)</i>
 * <li>Create recipients: <i>createRecipient($sKeyValue, $blSelectIfExistant)</i>
 * <li>Remove recipients: <i>removeRecipient($sKeyValue)</i>
 * <li>Manipulate recipient attributes <i>write($oAttribute, $oValue)</i>, <i>writeIfNull($oAttribute, $sValue)</i> and <i>writeTrackingPermission($lc, $oState)</i>
 * <li>Subscribe recipients: <i>subscribeIfNotUnsubscribed($oListContext, $sSubscriptionDate)</i>
 * <li>Unsubscribe recipients: <i>unsubscribe($oListContext)</i>
 * </ul>
 * The selection, creation and removal of recipients requires a value corresponding to the recipient key. 
 * Usually, this key is the email address. 
 * It is possible to use a different attribute as recipient key for the <i>BatchChannel</i>. 
 * To do this, use the <i>Inx_Api_Recipient_RecipientContext::createBatchChannel($oAttribute)</i> method to create 
 * the <i>Inx_Api_Recipient_BatchChannel</i> object and pass the attribute used as key. 
 * However, be aware that the attribute used as key should be unique, although this is no hard technical requirement. 
 * Using a non unique attribute as key will return any of the matching recipients (undetermined). 
 * Also, the creation of recipients using a different key attribute is not possible.
 * <p>
 * Note: Resubscription is not supported by <i>BatchChannel</i>.
 * If you wish to resubscribe a recipient, use <i>In_Api_Recipient_UnsubscriptionRecipientRowSet::resubscribe($sDate)</i> instead.
 * <p>
 * The following snippet shows how to add two new addresses and change their "Firstname" and "Lastname" attributes. 
 * If the addresses exist already, these attribute values will be overwritten.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * $oRecipientContext = $oSession->createRecipientContext();
 * $oBatchChannel = $oRecipientContext->createBatchChannel();
 * $oRecipientMetaData = $oRecipientContext->getMetaData();
 * 
 * $oBatchChannel->createRecipient( "mueller@yourcompany.com", true );
 * $oBatchChannel->write( $oRecipientMetaData->getUserAttribute( "Firstname" ), "George" );
 * $oBatchChannel->write( $oRecipientMetaData->getUserAttribute( "Lastname" ), "Müller" );
 *
 * $oBatchChannel->createRecipient( "clinton@yourcompany.com", true );
 * $oBatchChannel->write( $oRecipientMetaData->getUserAttribute( "Firstname" ), "Bill" );
 * $oBatchChannel->write( $oRecipientMetaData->getUserAttribute( "Lastname" ), "Clinton" );
 *
 * $retArr = $oBatchChannel->executeBatch();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note: The <i>boolean</i> parameter of <i>createRecipient</i> defines how to handle already existent recipients. 
 * If the parameter is set to <i>true</i> - as in the example - the recipient will only be created if it does not already exist. 
 * Existent recipients are selected instead. 
 * If the parameter is set to <i>false</i> the <i>BatchChannel</i> will attempt to create the recipient. 
 * If the recipient is not already existing it will be created and selected. 
 * However, if the recipient exists already, the result will be <i>RESULT_FAILURE_DUPLICATE_KEY</i> and the recipient will 
 * <b>not</b> be selected.
 * Therefore, all succeeding operations on this recipient will not be committed (<i>RESULT_NOT_COMMITTED</i>).
 * <p>
 * The selection and removal of recipients works very much the same, except that <i>removeRecipient($sKeyValue)</i> will 
 * not select the deleted recipient of course. 
 * After deleting a recipient, a new recipient must be selected (or created) before any tasks may be invoked. 
 * This is because the <i>remove()</i> method resets the currently selected recipient.
 * <p>
 * The ordering of commands does matter. If a recipient should be subscribed to a list and a certain tracking permission
 * should be set for them, the subscribe command must come first. Otherwise the tracking permission will be ignored.
 * There is a special list property however which allows writing a tracking permission to a list, even if the recipient 
 * is not subscribed to that list. If the property is set, ordering does not matter.
 * See <i>PropertyNames.TRACKINGPERMISSION_DETACHED_FROM_MEMBERSHIP</i>.
 * <p>
 * The <i>writeIfNull($oAttribute, $sValue)</i> method allows you to set an attribute value only, if no value was
 * assigned previously (i.e. the attribute value is <i>null</i>). 
 * A similar technique is used by <i>subscribeIfNotUnsubscribed($oListContext, $sDate)</i>. 
 * This method subscribes the selected recipient to the given list, only when the recipient was not unsubscribed from that list before.
 * <p>
 * Each command to the BatchChannel results in a value in the returned integer array. 
 * By scanning the array, you can find out which of the commands have been executed, and which have not.
 * <p>
 * The values produced by <i>removeRecipient()</i>:
 * <ul>
 * <LI>The recipientId is returned if the recipient is removed
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_KEY_NOT_FOUND</i> is returned if the recipient doesn't exists
 * </ul>
 * <P>
 * The values produced by <i>selectRecipient()</i>:
 * <ul>
 * <LI>The recipientId is returned if the recipient is selected
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_DUPLICATE_KEY</i> is returned if the unique key already exists
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_BLOCKED_BY_BLACKLIST</i> is returned if the email address is blocked
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_KEY_NOT_FOUND</i> is returned if the recipient doesn't exist
 * </ul>
 * <P>
 * The values produced by <i>createRecipient()</i>:
 * <ul>
 * <LI>The recipientId is returned if the recipient was successfully created or selected
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_DUPLICATE_KEY</i> is returned if the unique key already exists
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_BLOCKED_BY_BLACKLIST</i> is returned if the email address is blocked
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_ILLEGAL_VALUE</i> is returned if the key value is illegal
 * </ul>
 * <P>
 * The values produced by <i>write()</i>, <i>writeIfNull() and <i>writeTrackingPermission($lc, $oState)</i>
 * <ul>
 * <LI><i>RESULT_COMMITTED</i> is returned if the value is set and committed
 * <LI><i>RESULT_NOT_COMMITTED</i> is returned if the value is set, but could not be committed
 * <LI><i>RESULT_FAILURE_ILLEGAL_VALUE</i> is returned if the value of the attribute is illegal
 * </ul>
 * <P>
 * The values produced by <i>subscribeIfNotUnsubscribed()</i>
 * <ul>
 * <LI><i>RESULT_COMMITTED</i> is returned if the recipient was subscribed
 * <LI><i>RESULT_NOT_COMMITTED</i> is returned if the recipient was unsubscribed before
 * </ul>
 * <P>
 * The values produced by <i>unsubscribe()</i>
 * <ul>
 * <LI><i>RESULT_COMMITTED</i> is returned if the recipient was unsubscribed
 * <LI><i>RESULT_NOT_COMMITTED</i> is returned if the recipient was already unsubscribed before
 * </ul>
 * <p>
