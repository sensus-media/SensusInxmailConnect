/**
 * The <i>Inx_Api_TriggerMailing_Descriptor_TriggerType</i> enumeration defines the different types of triggers. The 
 * trigger types can be divided into two categories:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Time triggers</b>: Used for time controlled dispatch of trigger mailings.
 * <li><b>Action triggers</b>: Used for action controlled dispatch of trigger mailings.
 * </ol>
 * Time trigger mailings are sent out on a regular basis. The following time triggers are available:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Birthday</b>: A mailing of this type is sent to recipients on the annual recurrence of a specific date. A
 * datetime attribute of the recipient acts as a baseline and the mailing is sent every year after this baseline. An
 * offset can be specified to send the mailing some time before or after the annual recurrence. The condition is checked
 * once a day. The birthday trigger is an attribute driven time trigger.
 * <li><b>Anniversary</b>: A mailing of this type is sent to recipients on the recurrence of a specific date. A datetime
 * attribute of the recipient acts as baseline and the mailing is sent after a user defined period of time (years,
 * months or days) after this baseline. An offset can be specified to send the mailing some time before or after the
 * recurrence. The condition is checked once a day. The anniversary trigger is an attribute driven time trigger.
 * <li><b>Reminder</b>: A mailing of this type is sent to recipients on a specific date. A datetime attribute of the
 * recipient defines that date. An offset can be specified to send the mailing some time before the date. The condition
 * is checked once a day. The reminder trigger is an attribute driven time trigger.
 * <li><b>Follow up</b>: A mailing of this type is sent to recipients on a specific date. A datetime attribute of the
 * recipient defines that date. An offset can be specified to send the mailing some time after the date. The condition
 * is checked once a day. The follow up trigger is an attribute driven time trigger.
 * <li><b>Interval</b>: A mailing of this type is sent to all recipients of the associated list at a freely definable
 * interval (i.e. hourly, daily, weekly,...). The interval is described by an 
 * <i>Inx_Api_TriggerMailing_Descriptor_TriggerInterval</i> object. The interval trigger is a time trigger which is not 
 * related to a specific attribute.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Action trigger mailings, on the other hand, are only sent if the associated action is executed. Be aware that the
 * action cannot be defined by the trigger descriptor. Instead, the action contains a command (an 
 * <i>Inx_Api_Action_SendMailCommand</i>) which will send the mailing.
 * <p>
 * A note for programmers who are not familiar with the concept of enumerations: Enumerations or enumerated types are basically 
 * a fixed set of named values. They are usually used to define a couple of legitimate values in a specific context and serve a 
 * purpose similar to integer constants. 
 * The advantage of enumerations is, that you cannot specify any "weird" values because every value has to be an instance of 
 * the enumerated type. It is also possible to associate data or even behaviour (methods) with the values. 
 * PHP does not support such a language feature like Java and C# do. In most languages the named values are a sort of constant 
 * whose value is an instance of the enumerated type. In PHP a constant cannot contain a reference type. Therefore, we 
 * implemented enumerations as classes with private constructor and methods which return the named values.
 * Be aware that the objects returned by the static methods are always the same object. That way it is possible to use the 
 * identity operator (===) on these objects and use them comfortably in switch statements.
 *
