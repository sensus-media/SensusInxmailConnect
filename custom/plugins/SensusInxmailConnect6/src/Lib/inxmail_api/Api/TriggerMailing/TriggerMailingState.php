/**
 * The <i>Inx_Api_TriggerMailing_TriggerMailingState</i> enumeration defines the states in which a trigger mailing may 
 * transit. Most operations on trigger mailings are only allowed while the mailing is in a specific state. For example, 
 * a trigger mailing may only be edited while it is in the DRAFT state, which is the initial state.
 * <p>
 * If an operation is performed while in an illegal state, normally a <i>TriggerMailingStateException</i> will be
 * raised. The only exception is the commitUpdate method, which cannot throw a state exception as it is inherited from
 * <i>Inx_Api_BusinessObject</i>. Instead, commitUpdate will throw an <i>Inx_Api_UpdateException</i> stating that it is 
 * illegal to perform the action in the current state.
 * <p>
 * A note for programmers who are not familiar with the concept of enumerations: Enumerations or enumerated types are basically 
 * a fixed set of named values. They are usually used to define a couple of legitimate values in a specific context and serve a 
 * purpose similar to integer constants. 
 * The advantage of enumerations is, that you cannot specify any "weird" values because every value has to be an instance of 
 * the enumerated type. It is also possible to associate data or even behaviour (methods) with the values. 
 * PHP does not support such a language feature like Java and C# do. In most languages the named values are a sort of constant 
 * whose value is an instance of the enumerated type. In PHP a constant cannot contain a reference type. Therefore, we 
 * implemented enumerations as classes with private constructor and methods which return the named values.
 * Be aware that the objects returned by the static methods are always the same object. That way it is possible to use the 
 * identity operator (===) on these objects and use them comfortably in switch statements.
