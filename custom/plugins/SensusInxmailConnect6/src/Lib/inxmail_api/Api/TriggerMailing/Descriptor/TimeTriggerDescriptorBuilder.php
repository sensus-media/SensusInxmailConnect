 * The <i>Inx_Api_TriggerMailing_Descriptor_TimeTriggerDescriptorBuilder</i> builder is used to easily create time triggers. 
 * There are only two mandatory settings: the start date and the sending time which identify the date and time at which the 
 * trigger will be fired for the first time.
 * <p>
 * The following settings are optional:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>The end date</b>: Defines the date at which the trigger mailing will be dispatched for the last time.
 * <li><b>The attribute value setters</b>: Can be used to set recipient attribute values along with the dispatch of the
 * trigger mailing.
 * </ul>
