/**
 * An <i>Inx_Api_Action_Action</i> is a powerful tool which can manipulate or send a mail to a recipient for which 
 * an event has occurred. To do so, an <i>Inx_Api_Action_Action</i> has a list of commands that will be executed 
 * when the event occurs. Using this pattern, complex actions may be created. An <i>Inx_Api_Action_Action</i> could, 
 * for example, be configured to respond automatically to flame mails.
 * <p>
 * <i>Inx_Api_Action_Action</i>s can be accessed using the <i>Inx_Api_Action_ActionManager</i>.
 * <p>
 * The different types of commands are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_DeleteRecipientCommand</i> - Permanently remove the recipient.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_SendMailCommand</i> - Send a mailing to the recipient.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_SendActionMailCommand</i> - Send an action mailing to the recipient.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_SetValueCommand</i> - Set an attribute value of the recipient.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_SubscriptionCommand</i> - Subscribe the recipient.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_UnsubscriptionCommand</i> - Unsubscribe the recipient.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_GrantTrackingPermissionCommand</i> - Grant tracking permission.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_RevokeTrackingPermissionCommand</i> - Revoke tracking permission.
 * <li><i>Inx_Api_Action_TransferTrackingPermissionCommand</i> - Transfer tracking permission.
 * </ul>
 * These commands are created by the <i>Inx_Api_Action_CommandFactory</i> which can be obtained from the 
 * <i>Inx_Api_Action_ActionManager</i>.
 * <p>
 * There are different event types which are triggered by inxmail.
 * <p>
 * System-wide events (the owner is the SystemListContext):
 * <ul>
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_CLICK - A link in an email is clicked.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_HARD_BOUNCE - A hard bounce mail is received.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_SOFT_BOUNCE - A soft bounce mail is received.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_UNKNOWN_BOUNCE - An unknown mail is detected through the bounce mailbox.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_AUTO_RESPONDER_BOUNCE - An auto-responder mail is received through the bounce mailbox.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_AUTO_RESPONDER_REPLY - An auto-responder mail is received through the normal mailbox.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_FLAME_REPLY - A flame mail is received through the normal mailbox.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_UNKNOWN_REPLY - An unknown mail is detected through the normal mailbox.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * ListContext-specific events (the owner is a StandardListContext or a FilterListContext):
 * <ul>
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_NEWSLETTER_SENT - A newsletter was sent.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_SINGLE_MAIL_SENT - A single mail was sent.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_SUBSCRIBE - A recipient was successfully subscribed.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_UNSUBSCRIBE - A recipient was successfully unsubscribed.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_TRACKING_PERMISSION_GRANTED - A recipient granted tracking permission.
 * <li>EVENT_TYPE_TRACKING_PERMISSION_DENIED - A recipient revoked tracking permission.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note: The usage of <i>Inx_Api_Action_Action</i>s requires the api user right: <i>Inx_Api_UserRights::ACTION_FEATURE_USE</i>
 * <p>
 * For an example on how to use actions, see the <i>Inx_Api_Action_ActionManager</i> documentation.
