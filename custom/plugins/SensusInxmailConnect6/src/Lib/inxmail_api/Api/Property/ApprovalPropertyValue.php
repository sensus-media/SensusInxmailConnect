/**
 * The <i>Inx_Api_Property_ApprovalPropertyValue</i> is a wrapper class for the approval property values. 
 * This value determines if and how mailings shall be approved and by whom. 
 * An <i>Inx_Api_Property_ApprovalPropertyValue</i> therefore consists of three parts which define the approval strategy:
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>The approval type</i>: Defines if and how mailings shall be approved.
 * <li><i>The primary approver</i>: Approver that will be involved in all approval types immediately.
 * <li><i>The secondary approver</i>: Approver that will only get involved in certain conditions.
 * </ul>
 * If and how the approvers will get involved is determined from the approval type. 
 * The possible values for the approval type are:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>APPROVAL_TYPE_OFF</i>: Approval is completely turned off. 
 * No approver will get involved, the editor is the only one responsible for the correctness of the mailing content.
 * <li><i>APPROVAL_TYPE_SYSTEM</i>: The approval type is inherited from the system list.
 * <li><i>APPROVAL_TYPE_IDENTICAL</i>: Both approvers will get involved immediately. 
 * Only one of them has to approve the mailing.
 * <li><i>APPROVAL_TYPE_ESCALATION</i>: At first, only the primary approver will be involved. 
 * If the escalation date expires without the primary approver having approved the mailing, the secondary 
 * approver will get involved.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To convert an <i>Inx_Api_Property_ApprovalPropertyValue</i> into the internal representation needed for the 
 * approval property, use the 
 * <i>Inx_Api_Property_PropertyFormatter::createApprovalPropertyValue($oApprovalPropertyValue)</i> method. 
 * To convert the internal representation into an <i>Inx_Api_Property_ApprovalPropertyValue</i> object, use the
 * <i>Inx_Api_Property_PropertyFormatter::parseApprovalPropertyValue($oProperty)</i> method.
